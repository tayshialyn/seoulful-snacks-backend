// As a helper/utility class
// Utils is declared public and final, and have a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
// The final keyword prevents the class form being extended (as a subclass) - thus improving runtime-efficiency.
// JavaDoc comments/documentation is used here to provide context on what the methods accept as arguments and what it returns
// The class methods should be static and not be declared abstract (as that would imply the class is not concrete and has to be implemented in some way).
